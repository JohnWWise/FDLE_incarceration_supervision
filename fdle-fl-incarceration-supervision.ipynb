    "## Project Overview\n",
    "# Florida Department of Corrections Data Access Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This initiative aims to enhance public access to Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) data, as made available by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). The project seeks to transform technically available but practically inaccessible public data into a truly accessible and understandable resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The project lead brings a unique perspective to this work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spent nearly 19 years in the FDOC system\n",
    "- Earned a degree in data science post-incarceration\n",
    "- Currently works as a data annotator\n",
    "- Planning to pursue a master's degree in information and data science\n",
    "\n",
    "The author's experience of incarceration provides valuable context for understanding the data and its importance. However, the author has found that this experience can make the objective presentation of incarceration data difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clean and organize FDOC data that FDLE is legally required to make public\n",
    "2. Create a more accessible portal for this data, addressing limitations of the current FDLE public dashboard\n",
    "3. Provide a platform for public, researchers, and policymakers to explore and analyze the data independently\n",
    "4. Integrate AI assistance to enhance data navigation and comprehension (experimental approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objectivity**: The project aims to present data as objectively as possible, without drawing conclusions about the correctional or criminal legal systems\n",
    "- **Transparency**: By improving access to information, the project seeks to facilitate more informed discussions about Florida's correctional system\n",
    "- **Data Limitations**: Acknowledge and highlight gaps or unclear areas in current reporting\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: Transform technically available but difficult-to-use public data into a truly accessible and understandable resource\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has the potential to:\n",
    "- Empower researchers, policymakers, and the public with better access to critical information\n",
    "- Highlight areas where data collection or reporting could be improved\n",
    "- Foster more informed discussions and decision-making regarding Florida's correctional system\n",
    "- Demonstrate innovative approaches to making public data more accessible and useful\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project is sourced from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) as part of the Criminal Justice Data Transparency (CJDT) initiative. This initiative was established by the Florida Legislature through Florida Statutes §900.05 and §943.6871 to increase public visibility of criminal justice processes throughout the state and provide policymakers with information for informed decision-making. As per the CJDT data specifications it should include the records of juveniles treated as adults and the records of adults only.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Origin and Access\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data is available through the [FDC Incarceration and Supervision Reports](https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/CJAB/CJDT/FDC-IS-Reports) page on the FDLE website.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a description of the CJDT initiative and the data it encompasses, please refer to the [Criminal Justice Data Transparency](https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/CJAB/CJDT) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are specifically working with the Incarceration and Supervision Reports from the Florida Department of Corrections, which form a subset of the larger FDLE CJDT initiative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following context from the first of the two previous links is of critical importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The CJDT data collection process began in 2020 upon establishing state and local system capabilities that allow electronic data transmission from the contributor agencies to FDLE. CJDT records go only as far back as the inception of the initiative in 2018. However, if individual agencies choose to provide older records as part of their submission process, they will be included in the publicly available datasets.\"</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is **not clear** if the records in the dataset are for those currently in custody or under supervision, or if they include everyone who has been under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections since that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "While the FDLE updates the CJDT data daily, this project operates on a monthly update cycle. The data used in this analysis is manually retrieved and updated on a monthly basis. The project may eventually be updated to establish a live connection to the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent data download used in this analysis was performed on 2024-07-07.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to dynamically update its analysis when new data is provided. To update the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and unzip the latest data file from the FDLE website. This single file contains all three required datasets.\n",
    "2. Upload the new file to this notebook's environment.\n",
    "3. Update the filepath in the notebook to point to the new file.\n",
    "4. Run the notebook to automatically incorporate the new data into the analysis."

       "### Context\n",
       "The Criminal Justice Data Transparency (CJDT) initiative began in 2020, aimed at enhancing the electronic data transmission capabilities of state and local agencies to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). The records available in this dataset date back to the inception of the initiative in 2018. However, it is important to note that the dataset may not include all individuals who have been under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections since that time. Instead, it likely reflects only those who are currently or have recently been incarcerated or under supervision. This limitation could lead to a misleading perception of an increase in recent data, as the removal of older records may create the false impression of a rise in the number of records.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Dataset Variables\n",
       "The dataset includes the following key variables:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **CUSTODY_ADMISSION_DATE**: This variable records the date of admission to custody. It contains 112,894 non-null entries, with the oldest record dating back to January 19, 1960, and the most recent on June 4, 2024.\n",

       "### Explanation of the Visualization\n",
       "The line chart illustrates two distinct types of events: **Custody Admission** and **Supervision Begin**. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Custody Admission**: The data shows a significant increase in custody admissions from January 2021, starting with 771 admissions, peaking at 2,685 in March 2022, and then fluctuating around 1,900 to 2,300 in the subsequent months. This trend may suggest a growing number of individuals entering custody, but it is essential to consider the context of data collection and the potential exclusion of older records.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Supervision Begin**: In contrast, the counts for supervision starts are considerably lower, beginning with only 4 in January 2021 and gradually increasing to 331 by December 2023. This indicates a much smaller number of individuals beginning supervision compared to those entering custody.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Insights and Data Quality Concerns\n",
       "The stark difference in counts between custody admissions and supervision starts raises questions about the nature of the data. The significant increase in custody admissions could be influenced by the dataset's focus on current records, potentially leading to a misinterpretation of trends over time. \n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, the limited number of supervision records may reflect either a lower rate of individuals entering supervision or a data collection issue. Researchers and policymakers should be cautious in drawing conclusions from these trends without considering the limitations of the dataset and the context of the CJDT initiative. \n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, while the visualization provides valuable insights into the trends of custody admissions and supervision starts, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential biases and limitations inherent in the data collection process.\n",

       "\n",
       "### Insights\n",
       "1. **Admission Reasons**: The overwhelming majority of admissions are due to new convictions, which account for over 84% of the total. This suggests a significant focus on new criminal activity as a primary driver for incarceration.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Release Reasons**: The data indicates that most individuals are released simply as a result of completing their time (released), which constitutes nearly 79.3% of the release reasons. This could imply that a large portion of the population is not under supervision upon release.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Data Quality Considerations**: The admission reasons show a high concentration in a few categories, particularly new convictions. This could indicate potential data quality issues, such as underreporting of other reasons or a systemic bias in the types of offenses leading to incarceration. Additionally, the relatively low counts for technical violations and post-prison supervision violations may warrant further investigation to ensure comprehensive data capture.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Potential Research Directions**: Researchers may want to explore the implications of these admission and release patterns on recidivism rates, the effectiveness of probation and parole systems, and the socio-economic factors influencing these trends. \n",

       "\n",
       "### Dataset Variables\n",
       "- **INCARCERATION_CUSTODY_LEVEL_TYPE_DESC**: This variable describes the custody level type of incarcerated persons. It contains 78,637 non-null entries and is categorized into the following levels:\n",
       "  - **Close**: 33,335 (42.39%)\n",
       "  - **Medium**: 26,318 (33.47%)\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Incarceration Custody Level**: The pie chart illustrates the proportion of each custody level type. The **Close** custody level represents the largest segment, indicating that a significant number of incarcerated persons are held under close supervision. The **Maximum** custody level, however, accounts for a very small fraction, suggesting that only a limited number of individuals are in the highest custody level.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Supervision Categories**: The second pie chart displays the distribution of supervision categories. The majority of incarcerated persons are under **Probation**, followed by **Post-Prison Supervision/Parole**. The relatively small percentage of individuals under **Community Control** indicates that this form of supervision is less common.\n",

       "### Overview of the Data\n",
       "The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various institutions within the Florida Department of Corrections, detailing the number of incarcerated persons at each institution. The key variables in this dataset include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **CURRENT_INSTITUTION_ORI_TYPE_DESC**: This categorical variable represents the name of the current institution, with a total of 120 unique values.\n",
       "- **COUNTY_DESCRIPTION**: This categorical variable indicates the county in which the institution is located, with 52 unique values.\n",
       "\n",
       "As of July 17, 2024, there are notable discrepancies between the reported capacities of certain institutions and the data available. For instance, the Central Florida Reception Center has a reported capacity of 3,066 persons according to Wikipedia, while the Florida Department of Corrections lists the capacity of the Reception and Medical Center at 1,503 persons. The South Florida Reception Center is reported to have a capacity of 1,315 persons. The reasons for these disparities remain unclear and warrant further investigation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Visualization of Institutions by Count\n",
       "The following visualization illustrates the number of incarcerated persons at various institutions. The data is represented in a bar chart format, where the x-axis indicates the count of incarcerated persons, and the y-axis lists the institution types. Each bar is color-coded to represent different institutions, and the count of incarcerated persons is displayed on the bars for clarity.\n",

       "\n",
       "</div>\n",
       "\n",
       "### Insights from the Visualization\n",
       "1. **Institution Capacity**: The bar chart reveals that the **CENTRAL FLORIDA RECEPTION CENTER MAIN** has the highest count of incarcerated persons at **14,753**, followed by the **RECEPTION AND MEDICAL CENTER MAIN UNIT** with **8,982**. This indicates a significant concentration of incarcerated persons in these facilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Distribution Across Institutions**: The data shows a wide range of counts across different institutions, with some facilities housing over 10,000 persons, while others, such as the **RECEPTION AND MEDICAL CENTER WORK CAMP**, have only **1** person. This disparity may reflect differences in the types of facilities (e.g., reception centers vs. work camps) and their respective roles within the correctional system.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Potential Data Quality Concerns**: The discrepancies in reported capacities versus actual counts raise questions about data accuracy and reporting practices. It is essential to investigate these inconsistencies to ensure that the data reflects the true state of the correctional system.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Categorical Variables**: For the data scientist, it is crucial to note that the variable **CURRENT_INSTITUTION_ORI_TYPE_DESC** contains 120 unique values, while **COUNTY_DESCRIPTION** has 52 unique values. Understanding these categorical variables will aid in further analysis and segmentation of the data.\n",

       "The dataset includes several boolean indicator variables that provide insights into the habitual and violent offender status of incarcerated or supervised persons. Each variable has 998 non-null entries, all indicating a value of `False`. The variables are as follows:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **HABITUAL_OFNDR_IND**: Indicates whether the individual is a habitual offender.\n",
       "- **HABITUAL_VIOL_FELONY_OFNDR_IND**: Indicates whether the individual is a habitual violent felony offender.\n",
       "- **PRISON_RELEASEE_REOFNDR_IND**: Indicates whether the individual is a prison releasee reoffender.\n",
       "- **VIOLENT_CAREER_CRIM_IND**: Indicates whether the individual is classified as a violent career criminal.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Data Quality Concerns\n",
       "The fact that all 998 entries for these indicators are `False` raises significant concerns regarding data quality. This could suggest several possibilities:\n",
       "- The data may not have been collected or recorded accurately.\n",
       "- There may be a lack of individuals meeting these criteria within the dataset.\n",
       "- The indicators may not be relevant or applicable to the population represented in this dataset.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Visualization\n",
       "The following visualizations represent the indicator variables. Each pie chart illustrates the distribution of the boolean values for the respective indicators, although all charts will show the same result due to the uniformity of the data.\n",

       "\n",
       "### Insights from Visualizations\n",
       "The visualizations will show four pie charts, each titled according to the respective indicator variable. Given that all values are `False`, each chart will display a single segment representing 100% of the data. This lack of variability suggests that further investigation into the data collection methods and the population represented is necessary to understand the absence of `True` values. \n",
       "\n",
       "The data scientist should be aware of these variables:\n",

       "\n",
       "### Data Quality Concern\n",
       "The dataset contains only 4 non-null entries for the variable `DRUG_TYPE_DESC`, which indicates a significant limitation in the data quality. The singular representation of \"Cocaine\" with a count of 4 suggests that the dataset may not comprehensively capture the variety of drug types involved. This raises concerns about the reliability and completeness of the data.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Visualization Explanation\n",
       "The visualization titled \"Distribution of Drug Types\" is a pie chart that illustrates the distribution of drug types based on the available data. The chart indicates that 100% of the recorded instances pertain to \"Cocaine,\" with a cumulative percentage of 50.0%. This visualization is misleading due to the lack of diversity in the data, as it does not reflect a broader range of drug types that may be present in the population.\n",

There are **52 unique values** in this variable, indicating a diverse range of legal statutes that can be mapped to meaningful offense categories.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Insights on Statute Categories\n",

       "\n",
       "### Explanation of the Visualization\n",
       "In the waffle chart, the categories are color-coded, and the size of each category is proportional to the number of cases associated with it. For instance, the chart indicates that **Property Crimes** account for **45.18%** of the total cases, which is a significant portion. This suggests that property-related offenses are prevalent in the dataset.\n",

       "\n",
       "### Overview\n",
       "The dataset provides insights into the various statuses of sentences for incarcerated persons in Florida. The variable of interest is **SENTENCE_STATUS**, which categorizes the type of sentence each individual is serving. The dataset contains 998 non-null entries, indicating a comprehensive collection of data regarding sentence statuses.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Sentence Status Categories\n",
       "The **SENTENCE_STATUS** variable includes the following categories:\n",
       "- **Not Applicable**: 578 (57.92%)\n",
       "- **Concurrent**: 335 (33.57%)\n",
       "- **Consecutive**: 70 (7.01%)\n",
       "- **Coterminous/Concurrent**: 15 (1.50%)\n",
       "\n",
       "### Explanation of Categories\n",
       "- **Not Applicable**: This category represents cases where the sentence does not fall into either concurrent or consecutive classifications. This could include various legal circumstances or types of sentences that do not apply to the standard definitions.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Concurrent**: Concurrent sentences allow for overlapping terms, meaning that time served for one offense counts towards the time served for another linked offense. This is common in cases where multiple charges arise from a single event.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Consecutive**: In contrast, consecutive sentences require that one term be completed before the next begins. This means that the total time served is the sum of all sentences.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Coterminous/Concurrent**: This category indicates sentences that are both coterminous and concurrent, suggesting a unique legal situation where the terms overlap in a specific manner.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Visualization\n",
       "The following visualization illustrates the distribution of sentence statuses among the incarcerated persons in the dataset. \n",

       "\n",
       "### Insights from the Visualization\n",
       "The pie chart representation allows for a clear understanding of the distribution of sentence statuses. The majority of sentences fall under the \"Not Applicable\" category, which may warrant further investigation to understand the legal contexts that lead to this classification. \n",
       "\n",
       "The significant proportion of concurrent sentences suggests that many individuals are serving time for multiple offenses simultaneously, which could reflect the nature of criminal events in Florida. The relatively small percentages for consecutive and coterminous/concurrent sentences indicate that these types of sentences are less common.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Data Quality Considerations\n",
       "While the dataset appears robust with 998 non-null entries, the high percentage of \"Not Applicable\" statuses raises questions about the nature of these cases. It is essential to consider the legal definitions and contexts that lead to this classification, as it may impact the interpretation of the data. Additionally, the dataset does not provide information on the reasons behind the sentence statuses, which could be a limitation for deeper analysis. \n",

       "- The counts for some offenses, such as **Amphetamine-Sell** and **Trespassing**, are notably low, which may suggest either a lack of reporting or a lower incidence of these offenses in the dataset.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Categorical Variables for Data Scientists\n",
       "For data scientists working with this dataset, the following categorical variables are crucial:\n",
       "- **OFFENSE_FCIC_TYPE_DESC**: Describes the type of offense (e.g., \"Larceny\", \"Cocaine-Possess\").\n",
       "- **Degree_Level**: Indicates the severity of the charge (e.g., \"Third Degree Felony\", \"Misdemeanor\").\n",

       "\n",
       "### Overview\n",
       "This section presents a time series analysis of the creation dates of disciplinary records associated with incarcerated and supervised persons in Florida. The dataset captures the number of records created each month from February 2022 to July 2024. The variable of interest is `INCAR_SUPERV_CREATED_DATE`, which indicates the date when each record was created.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Data Insights\n",
       "The dataset contains a total of **378,632** records, with the earliest record creation date being **February 25, 2022**, and the latest being **July 1, 2024**. The following insights can be drawn from the data:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Monthly Trends**: The number of disciplinary records created varies significantly across months. For instance, there is a notable spike in record creation in **July 2023**, with **225,754** records created, which is an outlier compared to other months. This could indicate a specific event or policy change that led to an increase in disciplinary actions during that period.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Fluctuations**: After the peak in July 2023, the number of records created drops sharply in the following months, with only **220** records in **August 2023** and **234** in **September 2023**. This drastic decrease may suggest a return to normalcy or a reduction in disciplinary actions.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Recent Trends**: The data shows a gradual increase in record creation towards the end of 2023 and into 2024, with **39344** records in **July 2024**. This could indicate a rising trend in disciplinary actions or changes in reporting practices.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Visualization\n",
       "The following line chart visualizes the time series data, showing the count of disciplinary records created over time. The x-axis represents the date of record creation, while the y-axis indicates the count of records.\n",

       "\n",
       "</div>\n",
       "\n",
       "### Data Quality Considerations\n",
       "- **Outliers**: The significant spike in July 2023 should be investigated further to understand the underlying causes. It is essential to determine whether this increase is due to actual disciplinary actions or if it reflects changes in data collection or reporting practices.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Missing Data**: While the dataset appears comprehensive, it is crucial to verify if there are any missing months or anomalies in the data collection process that could affect the analysis.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Temporal Consistency**: The dataset spans a considerable time frame, and any changes in policies or practices over time should be considered when interpreting the trends observed in the data.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Variable Information for Data Scientists\n",
       "- **INCAR_SUPERV_CREATED_DATE**: This variable is of type `datetime64[ns]` and represents the date when the incarceration/supervision record was created. It contains **378,632** non-null entries.\n",
       "- **Count**: This is a calculated variable representing the number of records created in each month, which is not part of the original dataset but is essential for visualization purposes. \n",

       "However, potential data quality concerns may arise from the categorization process, particularly with the AI mapping of raw rule values into categories. This process may introduce biases or inaccuracies if not carefully managed. Additionally, the counts of violations and actions taken should be interpreted with caution, as they may reflect reporting practices or institutional policies rather than the actual prevalence of behaviors.\n",

Your primary role is to assist users by directing projects which analyze and visualize the datasets InacerationSupervision_00000, InacerationSupervisionCharge_00000, and InacerationSupervisiondisciplinary_00000, which are currently loaded in the coding environment as df_root, df_charges, and df_dis, respectively.\n",

    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. When a user's query requires code execution or data manipulation, you will manage the project by first verifying you have the necessary data. Then, create a broad plain language plan that includes which variables to use and how to use them. You have the autonomy to execute any plan by passing it to the coding agent, who will handle all code planning and coding. Do NOT micromanage the coding agent. Just ensure you have the variables needed to answer the user's query and provide the coding agent with a general plain language plan outlining which variables will be used and how. As project manager you do not know how to code, you will only approve plans where all the data needed is present, but you will not handle anything beyond passing the coding agent a broad plan on which variables will me used and in which way. Use the exact and precise variables and variable category values from the data available to you.\n",
    "2. Use the [EXECUTE] ... [/EXECUTE] format to pass the plain language plan to the coding agent. Do not pass json data to the coding agent.\n",
    "3. Always alert users that plan execution may take a few moments after passing the plan to the coding agent.\n",
    "4. If plan execution fails, explain the issue, reassess project feasability, and try again if you can succeed with a modified plan.\n",
    "5. If unable to answer a query, throughly explain why.\n",
    "7. Explain all coding agent results in context of all available information. Present the reasoning of the coding agent in plain language before the results.\n",
    "8. Always display all Altair plots inline with your response using the format: [ALTAIR_PLOT:filename.html].\n",
