The project seeks to transform technically available but practically inaccessible public data into a truly accessible and understandable resource.\n\n## Author Background\n\nThe project lead brings a unique perspective to this work:\n\n- Spent nearly 19 years in the FDOC system\n- Earned a degree in data science post-incarceration\n- Currently works as a data annotator\n- Planning to pursue a master's degree in information and data science\n\nThe author's experience of incarceration provides valuable context for understanding the data and its importance. However, the author has found that this experience can make the objective presentation of incarceration data difficult.\n\n## Project Goals\n\n1. Clean and organize FDOC data that FDLE is legally required to make public\n2. Create a more accessible portal for this data, addressing limitations of the current FDLE public dashboard\n3. Provide a platform for public, researchers, and policymakers to explore and analyze the data independently\n4. Integrate AI assistance to enhance data navigation and comprehension (experimental approach)\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **Objectivity**: The project aims to present data as objectively as possible, without drawing conclusions about the correctional or criminal legal systems\n- **Transparency**: By improving access to information, the project seeks to facilitate more informed discussions about Florida's correctional system\n- **Data Limitations**: Acknowledge and highlight gaps or unclear areas in current reporting\n- **Accessibility**: Transform technically available but difficult-to-use public data into a truly accessible and understandable resource\n\n## Expected Impact\n\nThis project has the potential to:\n- Empower researchers, policymakers, and the public with better access to critical information\n- Highlight areas where data collection or reporting could be improved\n- Foster more informed discussions and decision-making regarding Florida's correctional system\n- Demonstrate innovative approaches to making public data more accessible and useful\n\n# Data Sources\n\nThe data used in this project is sourced from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) as part of the Criminal Justice Data Transparency (CJDT) initiative. This initiative was established by the Florida Legislature through Florida Statutes §900.05 and §943.6871 to increase public visibility of criminal justice processes throughout the state and provide policymakers with information for informed decision-making. As per the CJDT data specifications it should include the records of juveniles treated as adults and the records of adults only.\n\n\n### Data Origin and Access\n\nThe raw data is available through the [FDC Incarceration and Supervision Reports](https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/CJAB/CJDT/FDC-IS-Reports) page on the FDLE website.\n\nFor a description of the CJDT initiative and the data it encompasses, please refer to the [Criminal Justice Data Transparency](https://www.fdle.state.fl.us/CJAB/CJDT) page.\n\nIn this project, we are specifically working with the Incarceration and Supervision Reports from the Florida Department of Corrections, which form a subset of the larger FDLE CJDT initiative.\n\n**The following context from the first of the two previous links is of critical importance:**\n\n<div style=\"background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n\n\"The CJDT data collection process began in 2020 upon establishing state and local system capabilities that allow electronic data transmission from the contributor agencies to FDLE. CJDT records go only as far back as the inception of the initiative in 2018. However, if individual agencies choose to provide older records as part of their submission process, they will be included in the publicly available datasets.\"</div>\n\nIt is **not clear** if the records in the dataset are for those currently in custody or under supervision, or if they include everyone who has been under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections since that time.\n\n### Data Updates\n\nWhile the FDLE updates the CJDT data daily, this project operates on a monthly update cycle. The data used in this analysis is manually retrieved and updated on a monthly basis. The project may eventually be updated to establish a live connection to the data source.\n\nThe most recent data download used in this analysis was performed on 2024-07-07.\n\nThis notebook is designed to dynamically update its analysis when new data is provided. To update the data:\n\n1. Download and unzip the latest data file from the FDLE website. This single file contains all three required datasets.\n2. Upload the new file to this notebook's environment.\n3. Update the filepath in the notebook to point to the new file.\n4. Run the notebook to automatically incorporate the new data into the analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Working with files from:\nupdate_path = 'fdle-fl-data-2024-07'\n\n#

presentation team.\nThe data you will present is a subset of metadata from a Florida Department of Law Enforcement file containing Florida Department of Corrections incarceration and supervision data. The main audience includes the public, researchers, and policymakers. This data has been downloaded in CSV format, cleaned, and used to create several visualizations. The purpose of the presentation is to make the information more accessible to the public.\n\nKey principles include objectivity, transparency, acknowledgment of data limitations, and accessibility. \n\nYou will also have a secondary audience: a data scientist with access to the loaded data. During your presentation, highlight critical information for the data scientist so they become familiar with the dataset variable names and data structures. Clearly identify dataset variables and specify categorical variable values precisely, maintaining case. This does not apply to calculated visualization variables like ‘count’ since they are not a concern for the data scientist who will be working with the dataset later.\n\nWhen you receive data in JSON, Markdown, and text format:\n- The JSON data represents Altair visualizations.\n- The text includes:\n    - The subject of the metadata subset\n    - Additional context\n    - One html file paths, which correspond to the Altair plot visualization file paths.\n    \nYou will:\n\n1. Use markdown formatting to enhance readability:\n    - Use the header ## to return the subject of the data, i.e., ## Demographics:\n    - Use the lower-level headers ### for subsections of your response.\n    \n2. For the html file path include a centered iframe tag in your markdown output to display the associated html file. Use the following format:\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"html_file_name.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\nUse iframe only for the tag. Do not use img and do not use markdown tagging.\n \n3. Present all numerical data in context.\n4. Explain all visualizations, including potential insights.\n5. Do not conclude with a summary or conclusion.\n6. Unless instructed to be succinct, aim for lengthy and very detailed responses.\n7. Only include one iframe tag in each response.\n8. Do not refer to incarcerated or supervised persons as 'inmates'\n or 'offenders'. They are 'incarcerated' or 'supervised' persons.\n9.

The author posits that any observed 'increase' in recent data is likely an indication that the the former is the case, that only those who are currently or have recently been incarcerated or under supervision are included - that the removal of older records can create the false impression that there is a current rise in the recent number of records. <<Contect for AI only: The json data you are being passed is filtered to the last three years.

It includes a total of 112,894 records, each identified by a unique identifier (INCARCERATION_SUPERVISION_ID). The dataset captures various demographic attributes such as race, sex, ethnicity, and age.\n\n### Key Variables\n- **INCARCERATION_SUPERVISION_ID**: Anonymized unique identifier for each record (112,894 unique values).\n- **RACE_CODE**: Categorical variable representing the race of the incarcerated/supervised person. The distribution is as follows:\n  - White: 55,703\n  - Black: 51,239\n  - Unknown: 5,815\n  - American Indian or Alaska Native: 108\n  - Asian: 29\n- **SEX_CODE**: Categorical variable indicating the sex of the incarcerated/supervised person:\n  - Male: 103,420\n  - Female: 9,474\n- **ETHNICITY_CODE**: Categorical variable for ethnicity:\n  - Not Hispanic or Latino: 97,214\n  - Hispanic or Latino: 13,519\n  - Unknown: 2,161\n- **INMATE_AGE**: Age of the incarcerated/supervised person, categorized as follows:\n  - <18: 0\n  - 18-24: 18,394\n  - 25-34: 37,926\n  - 35-44: 31,355\n  - 45-54: 16,142\n  - 55-64: 7,471\n  - 65+: 1,606\n\n### Visualization: Demographic Age and Race Distribution by Sex\nThe visualization presents the distribution of age and race among incarcerated and supervised persons, segmented by sex. The data is represented in two bar charts, one for females and one for males, allowing for a direct comparison of demographic characteristics.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Demographic_Age_and_Race_Distribution_by_Sex.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights from the Visualization\n- The bar charts illustrate the age distribution across different races for both sexes. \n- For females, the highest counts are observed in the age group 25-34, particularly among White Non-Hispanic individuals, followed by Black Non-Hispanic individuals.\n- Males show a similar trend, with the age group 25-34 also having the highest counts, predominantly among Black Non-Hispanic individuals.\n- The visualization highlights the significant representation of Black Non-Hispanic individuals in both sexes, particularly in the younger age groups (18-24 and 25-34).\n- Notably, the age group 65+ has the lowest counts across all racial and ethnic categories, indicating a potential area for further investigation regarding the aging population within the system.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n- The dataset contains a substantial number of \"Unknown\" entries for race and ethnicity, which may affect the overall analysis and insights derived from the data.\n- The age category \"<18\" has no recorded instances, which may suggest a lack of data for this demographic or a policy-related aspect that prevents individuals under 18 from being included in the dataset.\n- The distribution of race and ethnicity should be interpreted with caution, as the categories may not fully capture the diversity of the population.\n\nThis detailed examination of the demographics provides a foundation for understanding the characteristics of incarcerated and supervised persons in Florida, which can inform policy decisions and further research.\n\n## Education:\n\n### Overview of Highest Education Level\nThe dataset contains information on the highest level of education attained by 107,976 individuals. The variable `HIGHEST_EDUCATION_LEVEL` is categorized into various educational tiers, including Primary School, High School, College, and Grad School. The counts for each educational level are as follows:\n\n- **Twelfth Grade**: 39,824 (36.88%)\n- **Eleventh Grade**: 17,371 (16.09%)\n- **Tenth Grade**: 14,324 (13.27%)\n- **Ninth Grade**: 12,960 (12.0%)\n- **Eighth Grade**: 5,185 (4.8%)\n- **Seventh Grade**: 1,918 (1.78%)\n- **Sixth Grade**: 1,249 (1.16%)\n- **Fifth Grade**: 384 (0.36%)\n- **Fourth Grade**: 148 (0.14%)\n- **Third Grade**: 156 (0.14%)\n- **Second Grade**: 103 (0.1%)\n- **First Grade**: 69 (0.06%)\n- **Unknown**: 4,845 (4.49%)\n- **First Year of College**: 3,464 (3.21%)\n- **Second Year of College**: 3,807 (3.53%)\n- **Third Year of College**: 442 (0.41%)\n- **Fourth Year of College**: 1,405 (1.3%)\n- **First Year of Grad School**: 63 (0.06%)\n- **Second Year of Grad School**: 151 (0.14%)\n- **Third Year of Grad School**: 22 (0.02%)\n- **Fourth or More Years of Grad School**: 86 (0.08%)\n\n### Visualization of Educational Attainment\nThe following visualization illustrates the highest grade completed by individuals, represented by cumulative percentage and categorized by educational tier. This bar chart provides insights into the distribution of educational attainment among the population.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Higest_Grade_Completed_by_Cumulative_Percentage_and_Educational_Tier.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights from the Visualization\n- The chart shows a clear trend where the majority of individuals have completed high school, with a significant drop-off in those who have pursued higher education.\n- The cumulative percentage indicates that by the time individuals reach the Twelfth Grade, approximately 45.63% of the population has completed this level of education.\n- The educational tier breakdown reveals that a substantial portion of the population has only completed primary or secondary education, with only a small percentage achieving higher education levels.\n- The presence of a notable number of individuals with an \"Unknown\" education level (4,845) suggests potential data quality issues or lack of reporting, which could impact the overall analysis.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n- The \"Unknown\" category represents a significant portion of the dataset, which may skew the understanding of educational attainment. It is essential to investigate the reasons behind this unknown status to improve data completeness.\n- The dataset is limited to the highest education level attained, which may not reflect the full educational history of individuals. For example, some may have attended college but did not complete a degree, which is not captured in this dataset.\n\n### Variable Names for Data Scientists\nFor those working with the dataset, the following variable names and their respective values are critical:\n- **HIGHEST_EDUCATION_LEVEL**: Categorical values include \"First Grade\", \"Second Grade\", \"Third Grade\", \"Fourth Grade\", \"Fifth Grade\", \"Sixth Grade\", \"Seventh Grade\", \"Eighth Grade\", \"Ninth Grade\", \"Tenth Grade\", \"Eleventh Grade\", \"Twelfth Grade\", \"First Year of College\", \"Second Year of College\", \"Third Year of College\", \"Fourth Year of College\", \"First Year of Grad School\", \"Second Year of Grad School\", \"Third Year of Grad School\", \"Fourth or More Years of Grad School\", \"Unknown\".\n- **count**: Quantitative value representing the number of individuals at each education level.\n- **percentage**: Quantitative value representing the percentage of individuals at each education level relative to the total.\n- **cumulative percentage**: Quantitative value representing the cumulative percentage of individuals up to each education level.\n- **educational_tier**: Categorical values include \"Primary School\", \"High School\", \"College\", \"Grad School\". \n\nThis detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the educational landscape within the dataset, highlighting both the achievements and the gaps in educational attainment among the population.\n\n## Dates\n\n### Context\nThe Criminal Justice Data Transparency (CJDT) initiative began in 2020, aimed at enhancing the electronic data transmission capabilities of state and local agencies to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). The records available in this dataset date back to the inception of the initiative in 2018. However, it is important to note that the dataset may not include all individuals who have been under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections since that time. Instead, it likely reflects only those who are currently or have recently been incarcerated or under supervision. This limitation can lead to a misleading perception of an increase in recent data, as the removal of older records may create the false impression of a rise in the number of records.\n\n### Dataset Variables\nThe dataset includes the following key variables:\n\n- **CUSTODY_ADMISSION_DATE**: This variable records the date of admission to custody. It contains 112,894 non-null entries, with the oldest record dating back to January 19, 1960, and the most recent on June 4, 2024.\n  \n- **SUPERVISION_BEGIN_DATE**: This variable indicates the date supervision began, if applicable. It has 3,665 non-null entries, with the oldest record from April 27, 2006, and the most recent on May 14, 2024.\n\n### Visualization\nThe following visualization presents the counts of custody admissions and supervision starts from January 2021 to December 2023. \n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Counts_of_Custody_Admissions_And_Supervison_Starts,_2021_To_Present.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Explanation of the Visualization\nThe line chart illustrates two distinct types of events: **Custody Admission** and **Supervision Begin**. \n\n- **Custody Admission**: The data shows a significant increase in custody admissions from January 2021, starting with 771 admissions, peaking at 2,685 in March 2022, and then fluctuating over the subsequent months. The most recent data point in December 2023 indicates 1,665 custody admissions.\n\n- **Supervision Begin**: In contrast, the counts for supervision starts are considerably lower. The data begins with only 4 supervision starts in January 2021, with a gradual increase over time, reaching a peak of 331 in December 2023.\n\n### Insights\nThe stark difference in the counts of custody admissions compared to supervision starts suggests that the majority of individuals entering the system are being admitted to custody rather than beginning supervision. This could indicate a trend where more individuals are being incarcerated rather than being placed under supervision, which may warrant further investigation by policymakers and researchers.\n\n### Data Quality Concerns\nIt is essential to acknowledge potential data quality concerns, such as the incomplete representation of historical records and the possibility that the dataset may not fully capture all individuals under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections. This limitation could affect the interpretation of trends and patterns observed in the data.\n\n## Reasons\n\n### Overview\nThis section presents the reasons for admission to corrections and the reasons for release from custody. The dataset includes two key categorical variables: `CORRECTION_ADMISSION_REASON_DESC` and `CUSTODY_RELEASE_REASON_DESC`. \n\n- **CORRECTION_ADMISSION_REASON_DESC**: This variable has 112,894 non-null entries and categorizes the reasons for admission to corrections. The primary categories include:\n  - **New Conviction**: 95,010 entries (84.2%)\n  - **Violation of Probation - New Law Violation**: 9,900 entries (8.8%)\n  - **Violation of Probation - Technical**: 4,655 entries (4.1%)\n  - **Violation of Community Control - New Law Violation**: 1,641 entries (1.5%)\n  - **Violation of Community Control - Technical**: 1,612 entries (1.4%)\n  - **Violation of Post-Prison Supervision/Parole - New Law Violation**: 56 entries (0.05%)\n  - **Violation of Post-Prison Supervision/Parole - Technical**: 20 entries (0.02%)\n\n- **CUSTODY_RELEASE_REASON_DESC**: This variable has 25,310 non-null entries and categorizes the reasons for release from custody. The primary categories include:\n  - **Released**: 20,070 entries (79.3%)\n  - **Paroled/Probation**: 4,527 entries (17.9%)\n  - **Discharged/Expiration**: 689 entries (2.7%)\n  - **Paroled**: 24 entries (0.1%)\n\n### Visualizations\nThe visualizations compare the reasons for admission to corrections against the reasons for release from custody. Each pie chart represents the distribution of the respective categories.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Correction_Admission_Reasons_Vs_Custody_Release_Reasons.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights\n1. **Admission Reasons**: The overwhelming majority of admissions are due to new convictions, which account for over 84% of the total. This suggests a significant focus on new criminal activity as a primary driver for incarceration.\n  \n2. **Release Reasons**: The majority of releases are categorized as \"Released,\" indicating that a large portion of individuals are completing their sentences or being released without further supervision. The relatively small percentage of individuals released on parole or probation (approximately 18%) suggests that most individuals are not under continued supervision upon release.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n- The `CORRECTION_ADMISSION_REASON_DESC` variable has a high number of non-null entries, indicating good data completeness for admission reasons. However, the `CUSTODY_RELEASE_REASON_DESC` has fewer entries, which may suggest that not all release reasons are consistently recorded or that some individuals may not have a recorded release reason.\n- The categories for both variables are well-defined, but the small counts for some categories (e.g., \"Violation of Post-Prison Supervision/Parole - Technical\") may indicate that these are less common reasons for both admission and release, which could warrant further investigation into the underlying factors contributing to these low counts.\n\n## Indicators:\n\nThis section presents key indicators related to the metadata subset from the Florida Department of Corrections. The indicators provide insights into various aspects of the incarcerated and supervised persons within the dataset.\n\n### Indicator Variables:\n\n1. **PRIOR_INCARCERATION_IND**:\n   - **Description**: This boolean indicator signifies whether an individual has a history of prior incarceration.\n   - **Data**: \n     - **True**: 47,352 (41.9%)\n     - **False**: 65,542 (58.1%)\n   - **Non-null Count**: 112,894\n\n2. **INCARC_PROG_PARTICIPATION_IND**:\n   - **Description**: This boolean indicator shows whether an individual participated in incarceration programs.\n   - **Data**: \n     - **True**: 59,011 (52.3%)\n     - **False**: 53,883 (47.7%)\n   - **Non-null Count**: 112,894\n\n3. **SEXUAL_OFFENDER_IND**:\n   - **Description**: This boolean indicator identifies individuals who are classified as sexual offenders.\n   - **Data**: \n     - **True**: 20,735 (18.4%)\n     - **False**: 92,159 (81.6%)\n   - **Non-null Count**: 112,894\n\n4. **GANG_AFFILIATION_IND**:\n   - **Description**: This boolean indicator indicates whether an individual has gang affiliation.\n   - **Data**: \n     - **True**: 19,669 (17.4%)\n     - **False**: 93,225 (82.6%)\n   - **Non-null Count**: 112,894\n\n### Visualization Insights:\n\nThe visualizations associated with these indicators are presented in pie charts, which allow for a clear comparison of the proportions of each category within the indicators. \n\n- **PRIOR_INCARCERATION_IND**: The chart shows a significant majority of individuals (58.1%) have no prior incarceration, while 41.9% do. This could suggest a focus on rehabilitation for those with prior histories.\n  \n- **INCARC_PROG_PARTICIPATION_IND**: The participation in incarceration programs is relatively balanced, with a slight majority (52.3%) having participated. This indicates a potential area for further investigation into the effectiveness of these programs.\n\n- **SEXUAL_OFFENDER_IND**: A large majority (81.6%) are not classified as sexual offenders, which may reflect broader trends in the population or the effectiveness of preventive measures.\n\n- **GANG_AFFILIATION_IND**: Similar to the sexual offender status, a significant majority (82.6%) do not have gang affiliations, suggesting that gang-related issues may not be as prevalent in this dataset.\n\nThe visualizations can help researchers and policymakers understand the demographic and behavioral characteristics of the incarcerated and supervised persons, guiding decisions on resource allocation and program development.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Combined_Pie_Carts_For_bools.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n## Institutional Information\n\n### Overview\nThis section presents data related to the custody levels of incarcerated persons and their corresponding supervision categories. The dataset includes two primary variables: **INCARCERATION_CUSTODY_LEVEL_TYPE_DESC** and **SUPERVISION_CATEGORY_DESC**. \n\n### Dataset Variables\n- **INCARCERATION_CUSTODY_LEVEL_TYPE_DESC**: This variable describes the custody level type of incarcerated persons. It contains 78,637 non-null entries and is categorized into the following levels:\n  - **Close**: 33,335 (42.39%)\n  - **Medium**: 26,318 (33.47%)\n  - **Minimum**: 13,509 (17.18%)\n  - **Community**: 5,347 (6.80%)\n  - **Maximum**: 128 (0.16%)\n\n- **SUPERVISION_CATEGORY_DESC**: This variable indicates the category of supervision applicable to the incarcerated persons. It has 3,665 non-null entries and includes:\n  - **Probation**: 2,051 (55.96%)\n  - **Post-Prison Supervision/Parole**: 1,271 (34.68%)\n  - **Community Control**: 343 (9.36%)\n\n### Visualizations\nThe visualizations provide insights into the distribution of custody levels and supervision categories among incarcerated persons. \n\n1. **Incarceration Custody Level**: The pie chart illustrates the proportion of each custody level type. The **Close** custody level has the highest representation, accounting for over 42% of the total, followed by **Medium** and **Minimum** levels. The **Maximum** custody level is notably low, with only 128 individuals categorized as such.\n\n2. **Supervision Categories**: The second pie chart displays the distribution of supervision categories. **Probation** is the most common category, representing nearly 56% of the total, while **Community Control** has the least representation at just over 9%.\n\nThese visualizations highlight the significant differences in the distribution of custody levels and supervision categories, which can inform policymakers and researchers about the characteristics of the incarcerated population in Florida.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Incarceration_Custody_Level_Vs_Supervision_Categories.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n## Locations\n\n### Overview of the Data\nThe dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various institutions within the Florida Department of Corrections, detailing the number of incarcerated persons at each institution. The key variables in this dataset include:\n\n- **CURRENT_INSTITUTION_ORI_TYPE_DESC**: This categorical variable represents the name of the current institution, with a total of 120 unique values.\n- **COUNTY_DESCRIPTION**: This categorical variable indicates the county where the institution is located, with 52 unique values.\n\nAs of July 17, 2024, there are notable discrepancies between the reported capacities of certain institutions and the data available. For instance, the Central Florida Reception Center has a reported capacity of 3,066 persons according to Wikipedia, while the Florida Department of Corrections lists the capacity of the Reception and Medical Center at 1,503 persons. The South Florida Reception Center is reported to have a capacity of 1,315 persons. The reasons for these disparities remain unclear and warrant further investigation.\n\n### Visualization of Institutions by Count\nThe following visualization illustrates the number of incarcerated persons at various institutions. Each bar represents a different institution, with the height of the bar corresponding to the count of incarcerated persons.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Institutions_by_Count.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights from the Visualization\n- The **Central Florida Reception Center MAIN** has the highest count of incarcerated persons, totaling **14,753**. This suggests it plays a significant role in the overall capacity of the Florida correctional system.\n- The **Reception and Medical Center MAIN UNIT** follows with **8,982** persons, indicating its importance in providing medical services within the correctional system.\n- Other notable institutions include the **South Florida Reception Center** with **6,664** persons and the **Florida Women's Reception Center** with **5,314** persons.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\nWhile the dataset provides valuable insights, it is essential to acknowledge potential data quality concerns. The discrepancies in reported capacities versus actual counts at certain institutions may indicate issues with data reporting or updates. Researchers and policymakers should consider these factors when interpreting the data and making decisions based on it. \n\nThe dataset contains **112,894 non-null** entries, which suggests a robust dataset; however, the unique values in categorical variables should be examined for consistency and accuracy. \n </span>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# IncarcerationSupervisionCharge_00000 Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Dropping redundant columns from the charges dataset\ncharges_to_drop = ['FCIC_CODE', 'SUP_ASSIGNED_MAXIMUM_TERM_CODE', 'MAXIMUM_TERM_CODE', 'STATUTE_CHAPTER_CODE', 'STATUTE_SECTION', 'STATUTE_SUBSECTION', 'SUPERVISION_REVOCATION_REASON', 'SENTENCE_STATUS_CODE', 'MINIMUM_TERM_DURATION_DAYS', 'SENTENCE_PROBATION_DURATION_DAYS']\ndf_charges = df_charges.drop(columns = charges_to_drop)\n\n# Defining a mapping dictionary for county codes to county names\ncounty_code_mapper = {6.0: 'BROWARD', 58.0: 'SARASOTA', 41.0: 'MANATEE', 4.0: 'BRADFORD', 51.0: 'PASCO', 32.0: 'JACKSON', 3.0: 'BAY', 30.0: 'HOLMES', 29.0: 'HILLSBOROUGH', 11.0: 'COLLIER', 49.0: 'OSCEOLA', 17.0: 'ESCAMBIA', 50.0: 'PALM BEACH', 12.0: 'COLUMBIA', 13.0: 'MIAMI-DADE', 5.0: 'BREVARD', 52.0: 'PINELLAS', 1.0: 'ALACHUA', 53.0: 'POLK', 47.0: 'OKEECHOBEE', 36.0: 'LEE', 48.0: 'ORANGE', 16.0: 'DUVAL', 64.0: 'VOLUSIA', 59.0: 'SEMINOLE', 54.0: 'PUTNAM', 8.0: 'CHARLOTTE', 55.0: 'ST.

This feature lets you zoom in on particular parts of the distribution for each variable, making it easier to examine patterns or details that might be hard to see in the full dataset.

Below are the details of each variable:\n\n- **CONCURRENT_SENTENCES_SERVED_DAYS**: \n  - **Type**: int64\n  - **Description**: Days served for concurrent sentences.\n  - **Non-null Count**: 998\n  - **Min**: 0.00, **Max**: 3336.00, **Median**: 0.00\n\n- **CONSECUTIVE_SENTENCES_SERVED_DAYS**: \n  - **Type**: int64\n  - **Description**: Days served for consecutive sentences.\n  - **Non-null Count**: 998\n  - **Min**: 0.00, **Max**: 935.00, **Median**: 0.00\n\n- **SENTENCE_SERVED_DAYS**: \n  - **Type**: int64\n  - **Description**: Total days served for the sentence.\n  - **Non-null Count**: 998\n  - **Min**: 0.00, **Max**: 10847.00, **Median**: 0.00\n\n- **SUP_ASSIGNED_TERM_DURATION_DAYS**: \n  - **Type**: int64\n  - **Description**: Assigned duration of supervision term in days.\n  - **Non-null Count**: 998\n  - **Min**: 0.00, **Max**: 32873.00, **Median**: 759.00\n\n- **GAIN_TIME_EARNED**: \n  - **Type**: float64\n  - **Description**: Amount of time earned for good behavior.\n  - **Non-null Count**: 101\n  - **Min**: 0.00, **Max**: 6102.00, **Median**: 242.00\n\n- **MAXIMUM_TERM_DURATION_DAYS**: \n  - **Type**: int64\n  - **Description**: Maximum sentence duration in days.\n  - **Non-null Count**: 998\n  - **Min**: 0.00, **Max**: 10958.00, **Median**: 0.00\n\n- **SUPERVISION_SERVED_DAYS**: \n  - **Type**: int64\n  - **Description**: Days served under supervision.\n  - **Non-null Count**: 998\n  - **Min**: 0.00, **Max**: 32873.00, **Median**: 759.00\n\n### Visualization Insights\nThe interactive visualization presents seven histograms, each corresponding to the variables listed above. The top charts display the full distribution of data, allowing users to click and drag to select specific ranges. This feature enables a focused examination of particular segments of the data, which can reveal patterns or anomalies that may not be apparent in the overall distribution.\n\nOne notable observation is that the most common entry among the few non-null values is 0, indicating a potential issue with data quality. This suggests that many records may not have been accurately captured or that there are significant gaps in the data. The presence of a high number of zero values across multiple variables raises concerns about the completeness and reliability of the dataset.\n\n### Data Quality Concerns\nThe dataset shows a significant number of non-null values for most variables, but the **GAIN_TIME_EARNED** variable has only 101 non-null entries, which could indicate that this data is either not consistently recorded or not applicable in many cases. The high median values of 0 for several variables also suggest that many individuals may not have served any time, which could skew the analysis.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Sentencing_Metrics_Explorer:_7_Variables_at_a_Glance.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n## Indicators:\n\n### Overview of Indicator Variables\nThe dataset includes several boolean indicator variables that provide insights into the habitual and violent offender status of incarcerated or supervised persons. Each variable has 998 non-null entries, all indicating a value of `False`. The variables are as follows:\n\n- **HABITUAL_OFNDR_IND**: Indicates whether the individual is a habitual offender.\n- **HABITUAL_VIOL_FELONY_OFNDR_IND**: Indicates whether the individual is a habitual violent felony offender.\n- **PRISON_RELEASEE_REOFNDR_IND**: Indicates whether the individual is a prison releasee reoffender.\n- **VIOLENT_CAREER_CRIM_IND**: Indicates whether the individual is classified as a violent career criminal.\n\n### Data Quality Concerns\nThe uniformity of the `False` values across all 998 entries raises potential data quality concerns. This could suggest that the data may not have been accurately captured or that there is a lack of diversity in the dataset regarding these indicators. It is essential to investigate the data collection methods and ensure that the indicators are being recorded correctly.\n\n### Visualization\nThe following visualizations represent the indicator variables. Each pie chart illustrates the distribution of the boolean values for the respective indicators. Given that all values are `False`, the visualizations will reflect this uniformity.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Charges_Indicators.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights from Visualizations\nThe visualizations will show a single segment for each indicator, representing the count of `False` values. This reinforces the concern regarding the lack of variability in the data. The absence of `True` values suggests that either the population sampled does not include habitual or violent offenders, or there may be an issue with the data collection process. Further analysis is needed to understand the implications of these findings and to ensure that the dataset accurately reflects the population it intends to represent.\n\n## Drug Type\n\n### Data Quality Concern\nThe dataset contains only 4 non-null entries for the variable `DRUG_TYPE_DESC`, which indicates a significant limitation in the data quality. The only drug type represented is \"Cocaine,\" which accounts for 100% of the entries. This raises concerns about the comprehensiveness and reliability of the data, as it does not reflect a diverse range of drug types that may be involved in incarceration or supervision cases.\n\n### Visualization Explanation\nThe visualization titled \"Distribution of Drug Types\" is a pie chart that illustrates the distribution of drug types based on the available data. Given that there is only one drug type represented, the chart will show a single segment for \"Cocaine,\" with a count of 4 and a percentage of 100%. \n\nThis visualization does not provide meaningful insights due to the lack of variety in the data. The cumulative percentage is also noted as 50.0%, which may not be relevant in this context since there is only one category present.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Drug_type_descriptions.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n## Statutes:\n\n### Overview\nThe dataset contains a variable named **STATUTE**, which has 998 non-null entries and represents legal statutes related to various charges. This variable is categorized into 52 unique values, indicating a diverse range of legal statutes. The significance of the number of unique values in the STATUTE variable suggests a complex legal landscape that can be analyzed for various insights.\n\n### AI Mapping\nAn important aspect of this dataset is the use of AI mapping to convert raw statute chapter numbers (e.g., '817.62.1') into meaningful offense categories. It is crucial to note that these categories are generated by AI, which may introduce some variability in the categorization process. This AI-generated categorization allows for a more intuitive understanding of the data, but it also necessitates caution regarding the accuracy and reliability of the classifications.\n\n### Visualization\nThe following visualization illustrates the distribution of statute categories using a waffle chart, which provides a clear and engaging representation of the data.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Distribution_of_Statute_Categories(Waffle_Chart).html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights from the Waffle Chart\nThe waffle chart visually represents the distribution of different statute categories. Here are some key observations:\n\n- **Property Crimes**: This category is the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 45.18% of the total counts, with a total of 450 instances. This suggests that property crimes are a significant concern within the dataset.\n  \n- **Drug Offenses**: Following property crimes, drug offenses represent about 33.73% of the total counts, with 336 instances. This indicates a substantial focus on drug-related legal issues.\n\n- **Public Order Crimes**: This category comprises around 13.55% of the total counts, with 135 instances. It highlights the importance of maintaining public order within the legal framework.\n\n- **White Collar Crimes and Traffic Offenses**: These categories are less represented, with white-collar crimes at approximately 3.51% (35 instances) and traffic offenses at about 1.71% (17 instances). This may suggest that these types of offenses are less common in the dataset or that they are less frequently prosecuted.\n\n- **DUI**: This category has the least representation, with only 8 instances, accounting for about 0.80%. This could indicate either a lower incidence of DUI charges or a potential area for further investigation.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\nWhile the AI-generated categories provide a useful framework for understanding the data, it is essential to acknowledge potential limitations. The accuracy of the AI mapping can vary, and there may be instances where the categorization does not fully capture the nuances of specific legal statutes. Additionally, the dataset's reliance on the completeness and correctness of the original legal data is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the insights derived from this analysis.\n\n### Interactive AI Chatbot\nAt the end of this document, the audience will have the opportunity to define their own categories using an interactive AI chatbot. This feature allows users to engage with the data actively and explore different categorizations based on their interests or research needs.\n\n## Sentence Statuses:\n\n### Overview\nThe dataset provides insights into the various statuses of sentences for incarcerated persons in Florida. The variable of interest is **SENTENCE_STATUS**, which categorizes the type of sentence each individual is serving. The dataset contains 998 non-null entries, indicating a comprehensive collection of data regarding sentence statuses.\n\n### Sentence Status Categories\nThe **SENTENCE_STATUS** variable includes the following categories:\n- **Not Applicable**: 578 (57.92%)\n- **Concurrent**: 335 (33.57%)\n- **Consecutive**: 70 (7.01%)\n- **Coterminous/Concurrent**: 15 (1.50%)\n\n### Explanation of Sentence Types\n- **Not Applicable**: This category represents cases where the sentence does not fall into the concurrent or consecutive classifications. This could include various legal circumstances or types of sentences that do not apply to the standard definitions.\n  \n- **Concurrent**: In this scenario, sentences overlap, meaning that time served for one offense counts towards the time served for another linked offense. This is common in cases where multiple charges arise from a single event.\n\n- **Consecutive**: Here, sentences are served one after the other. An individual must complete the first sentence before beginning the next, which can lead to longer total time served.\n\n- **Coterminous/Concurrent**: This is a less common classification where sentences are both coterminous and concurrent, indicating a unique legal situation where the sentences are linked in a specific manner.\n\n### Visualization\nThe following visualization illustrates the distribution of sentence statuses among the incarcerated persons in the dataset. Each segment of the chart represents the proportion of each sentence status category, providing a clear visual representation of how these statuses are distributed.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Distribution_of_Sentece_Statuses.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights from the Visualization\nFrom the visualization, it is evident that the majority of sentences fall under the **Not Applicable** category, accounting for over half of the dataset. This could suggest a need for further investigation into the types of sentences that are classified as not applicable and the reasons behind this classification.\n\nThe **Concurrent** category, while significant, is less than half of the **Not Applicable** category, indicating that a substantial number of sentences do not overlap. The **Consecutive** and **Coterminous/Concurrent** categories represent a small fraction of the total, which may reflect the nature of the offenses or the legal decisions made in these cases.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\nIt is important to acknowledge potential data quality concerns. The high percentage of **Not Applicable** statuses may warrant further scrutiny to ensure that these classifications are accurate and meaningful. Additionally, the relatively low counts for **Consecutive** and **Coterminous/Concurrent** sentences could indicate either a true reflection of sentencing practices or potential gaps in data collection for these categories.\n\n## FCIC Sentence Offences Categories by Degree Type\n\n### Overview\nThis dataset provides insights into the types of offenses categorized by their degree level as recorded by the Florida Crime Information Center (FCIC). The data includes a total of 998 non-null entries, detailing various offense types and their corresponding degree levels. The offense types are categorized into several descriptions, while the degree levels indicate the severity of the charges.\n\n### Offense Types\nThe dataset includes a variety of offense types, with the following counts for the most prevalent categories:\n- **Larceny**: 446 occurrences\n- **Cocaine-Possess**: 113 occurrences\n- **Fraud-Insuff Funds Check**: 104 occurrences\n- **Dangerous Drugs**: 53 occurrences\n- **Cocaine-Sell**: 49 occurrences\n- **Failure To Appear**: 32 occurrences\n- **Marijuana-Sell**: 27 occurrences\n- **Fraud-Illeg Use Credit Cards**: 26 occurrences\n- **Public Order Crimes**: 26 occurrences\n- **Marijuana-Possess**: 23 occurrences\n\n### Degree Levels\nThe degree levels of the charges are categorized as follows:\n- **Third Degree Felony**: 846 occurrences\n- **Second Degree Felony**: 76 occurrences\n- **Misdemeanor**: 55 occurrences\n- **First Degree Felony**: 13 occurrences\n- **Not Applicable**: 8 occurrences\n\n### Visualization\nThe following visualization illustrates the relationship between the offense types and their respective counts, categorized by degree level. This bar chart allows for a clear comparison of how many times each offense type has been recorded across different degree levels.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Offense_Types_by_Count_and_Degree_Level.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights from the Visualization\n- The bar chart clearly shows that **Larceny** is the most frequently recorded offense, appearing across multiple degree levels, predominantly as a **Third Degree Felony**.\n- **Cocaine-Possess** and **Fraud-Insuff Funds Check** also appear frequently, indicating significant issues related to drug possession and financial fraud.\n- The visualization highlights that the majority of offenses fall under the **Third Degree Felony** category, suggesting that many offenses are considered less severe but still prevalent.\n- Notably, there are offenses like **Robbery** and **Heroin-Possess** that have very low counts, which may indicate either a lower incidence of these crimes or potential data quality concerns, such as underreporting.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\nWhile the dataset provides a comprehensive overview of offense types and their degree levels, it is essential to acknowledge potential limitations:\n- The \"Not Applicable\" category may indicate cases where the degree level was not assigned, which could skew the understanding of the severity of certain offenses.\n- The counts for some offenses are significantly lower, which may warrant further investigation into whether these figures accurately reflect the reality of crime rates or if they are influenced by reporting practices.\n\nThis detailed examination of the offense types and their degree levels provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and the public, facilitating informed discussions around crime and justice in Florida.\n\n## County of Conviction\n\n### Overview\nThe dataset provides a breakdown of the number of convictions by county in Florida. This information is crucial for understanding the geographical distribution of convictions across the state. The data highlights the counties with the highest and lowest numbers of convictions, which can inform policymakers and researchers about regional crime trends and law enforcement activities.\n\n### Data Insights\nThe following are the conviction counts by county:\n\n- **Pinellas**: 337\n- **Miami-Dade**: 150\n- **Broward**: 128\n- **Bay**: 43\n- **Pasco**: 41\n- **Monroe**: 37\n- **Escambia**: 31\n- **Leon**: 30\n- **Brevard**: 25\n- **Palm Beach**: 21\n- **Polk**: 17\n- **Hillsborough**: 16\n- **Duval**: 13\n- **Orange**: 11\n- **Volusia**: 8\n- **St. Lucie**: 7\n- **Indian River**: 7\n- **Sarasota**: 7\n- **Clay**: 6\n- **Gadsden**: 6\n- **Osceola**: 5\n- **Marion**: 5\n- **Manatee**: 5\n- **Hardee**: 4\n- **Alachua**: 3\n- **Collier**: 3\n- **DeSoto**: 3\n- **Flagler**: 3\n- **St. Johns**: 3\n- **Seminole**: 3\n- **Charlotte**: 2\n- **Lee**: 2\n- **Nassau**: 2\n- **Martin**: 2\n- **Dixie**: 1\n- **Jefferson**: 1\n- **Liberty**: 1\n- **Highlands**: 1\n- **Jackson**: 1\n- **Hendry**: 1\n- **Okeechobee**: 1\n- **Okaloosa**: 1\n- **Putnam**: 1\n\n### Visualization\nThe visualization associated with this data is a choropleth map, which visually represents the number of convictions across different counties in Florida. This type of map allows for quick identification of areas with high and low conviction rates.\n\nIt is important to note that the lack of reporting in many counties indicates that the map primarily reflects which counties are submitting data rather than providing a complete picture of convictions across the state. This limitation should be acknowledged when interpreting the results.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"florida_counties_choropleth.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Data Quality Concerns\nThe data quality may be impacted by the non-reporting of certain counties, which could lead to an underrepresentation of the actual number of convictions statewide. Researchers and policymakers should consider this limitation when analyzing the data and making decisions based on the visualizations. Additionally, the dataset does not provide context regarding the nature of the convictions, which could further inform understanding of the data. \n\n </span>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# IncarcerationSupervisionDisciplinary_00000 Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# List of columns to drop from the df_dis DataFrame\ndisc_cols_to_drop = ['INCAR_DISCIPLINARY_VIOL_CODE', 'INCAR_DISCIPLINARY_ACTION_CODE', 'UNIQUE_CORRELATION_ID', 'CORRELATION_ID']\n# Drop the specified columns\ndf_dis = df_dis.drop(columns = disc_cols_to_drop)\n\n# Convert specified columns to categorical type for memory efficiency\ncategorical_columns = ['INCARCERATION_DISCIPLINARY_ACTION_TYPE_DESC', 'INCARCERATION_DISCIPLINARY_VIOLATION_TYPE_DESC']\nfor col in categorical_columns:\n    df_dis[col] = df_dis[col].astype('category')\n\n# Convert the 'INCAR_SUPERV_CREATED_DATE' column to datetime type    \ndf_dis['INCAR_SUPERV_CREATED_DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df_dis['INCAR_SUPERV_CREATED_DATE'])\n\n# Define descriptions for each column in df_dis\ndescriptions_dis = [\n    \"Anonymized unique identifier\",\n    \"Description of the type of disciplinary action taken\",\n    \"Description of the type of disciplinary violation\",\n    \"Date when the incarceration/supervision record was created\"\n]\n\n# Function to generate a Markdown table with DataFrame information for df_dis\ndef df_dis_info_markdown(df, descriptions=None, display_output=True):\n    # Get basic DataFrame info\n    rows, cols = df.shape\n    memory_usage = df.memory_usage(deep=True).sum()\n    memory_usage_str = f\"{memory_usage / 1024**2:.2f} MB\" if memory_usage > 1024**2 else f\"{memory_usage / 1024:.2f} KB\"\n    \n    # Construct the Markdown content\n    content = f\"\"\"\n## IncarcerationSupervisionDisciplinary_00000 Data Information:\n- **Rows**: {rows}\n- **Columns**: {cols}\n- **Memory Usage**: {memory_usage_str}\n### Data Details:\n| Column | Non-Null Count | Dtype | Description | Value Distribution |\n|--------|----------------|-------|-------------|---------------------|\n\"\"\"\n    # Iterate through columns to add their details to the Markdown table\n    for i, col in enumerate(df.columns):\n        dtype = df[col].dtype\n        non_null = df[col].count()\n        description = descriptions[i] if descriptions and i < len(descriptions) else \"\"\n        \n        # Determine value distribution based on column type\n        if col == \"INCARCERATION_DISCIPLINARY_ACTION_TYPE_DESC\":\n            value_dist = df[col].value_counts().to_dict()\n            value_dist_str = \", \".join([f\"{k}: {v}\" for k, v in value_dist.items()])\n        elif col == \"INCAR_SUPERV_CREATED_DATE\":\n            earliest = df[col].min().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n            latest = df[col].max().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n            value_dist_str = f\"Earliest: {earliest}, Latest: {latest}\"\n        else:\n            value_dist_str = f\"{df[col].nunique()} unique values\"\n        \n        content += f\"| {col} | {non_null} non-null | {dtype} | {description} | {value_dist_str} |\\n\"\n    \n    # Display the Markdown if display_output is True\n    if display_output:\n        display(Markdown(content))\n    \n    # Return the Markdown content as a string\n    return content\n\n# Generate the Markdown content for df_dis\ndf_dis_content = df_dis_info_markdown(df_dis, descriptions_dis)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-27T21:13:56.182507Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-27T21:13:56.183146Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-27T21:13:56.425742Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-27T21:13:56.183112Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-27T21:13:56.424820Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"\n## IncarcerationSupervisionDisciplinary_00000 Data Information:\n- **Rows**: 378632\n- **Columns**: 4\n- **Memory Usage**: 6.52 MB\n### Data Details:\n| Column | Non-Null Count | Dtype | Description | Value Distribution |\n|--------|----------------|-------|-------------|---------------------|\n| INCARCERATION_SUPERVISION_ID | 378632 non-null | int64 | Anonymized unique identifier | 46910 unique values |\n| INCARCERATION_DISCIPLINARY_ACTION_TYPE_DESC | 378632 non-null | category | Description of the type of disciplinary action taken | Disciplinary Confinement: 202840, Loss of Gain Time: 77972, Cashless Canteen Denial: 34823, Privilege Suspension -

The shared area between the circles represents the overlap of 46,324 persons between these datasets. \n\n### Dataset Variables\n- **Dataset Names**: \n  - `IncarcerationSupervision_00000`\n  - `IncarcerationSupervisionDisciplinary_00000`\n- **Overlap**: 46,324 (the number of persons common to both datasets)\n- **Size**: \n  - `IncarcerationSupervision_00000`: 112,894\n  - `IncarcerationSupervisionDisciplinary_00000`: 46,910\n\n### Insights\nThe visualization indicates that while there is a significant overlap of 46,324 persons, the total sizes of the datasets differ considerably, with `IncarcerationSupervision_00000` being substantially larger. This suggests that the disciplinary dataset may focus on a specific subset of the larger dataset.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Dataset_Size_Comparison2.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n## Disciplinary Record Creation Dates\n\n### Overview\nThis section presents a time series analysis of the creation dates of disciplinary records associated with incarcerated and supervised persons in Florida. The dataset captures the number of records created each month from February 2022 through July 2024. The variable of interest is `INCAR_SUPERV_CREATED_DATE`, which indicates the date when each record was created.\n\n### Data Insights\nThe dataset contains a total of 378,632 records, with the earliest record creation date being February 25, 2022, and the latest being July 1, 2024. The following insights can be drawn from the data:\n\n- **Monthly Trends**: The number of disciplinary records created varies significantly from month to month. For instance, there is a notable spike in record creation in July 2023, with a count of **225,754** records. This is an outlier compared to other months, suggesting a possible event or change in policy that led to an increase in disciplinary actions or reporting.\n  \n- **Seasonal Patterns**: The data shows fluctuations in record creation, with some months experiencing higher counts than others. For example, the months of May 2023 and July 2023 stand out with counts of **44,160** and **225,754**, respectively, while other months like August 2023 and September 2023 show significantly lower counts of **220** and **234**.\n\n- **Recent Trends**: The most recent months (from August 2023 to July 2024) show a decline in the number of records created, with counts dropping to as low as **102** in December 2023. This could indicate a decrease in disciplinary actions or changes in reporting practices.\n\n### Visualization\nThe following visualization illustrates the time series of disciplinary record creation by month, allowing for a clearer understanding of trends over time.\n\n<div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Time_Series_of_Disciplinary_Record_Creation_by_Month.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n- **Outliers**: The significant spike in July 2023 raises questions about data quality or external factors influencing the number of records. It is essential to investigate the context behind this spike to understand whether it reflects a genuine increase in disciplinary actions or if it is a result of data reporting changes.\n\n- **Missing Data**: While the dataset appears comprehensive, it is crucial to verify if there are any missing months or anomalies in the data collection process that could affect the analysis.\n\n### Variable Information for Data Scientists\n- **INCAR_SUPERV_CREATED_DATE**: This variable is of type `datetime64[ns]` and represents the date when the incarceration/supervision record was created. It contains **378,632** non-null entries, with the earliest date being **2022-02-25** and the latest **2024-07-01**.\n- **Count**: This is a calculated variable representing the number of records created in each month, which is essential for understanding trends over time.\n\nThis detailed analysis and visualization aim to provide insights into the disciplinary record creation process, highlighting trends and potential areas for further investigation.\n\n## Alleged Disciplinary Infractions and Outcomes\n\n### Overview\nThis section presents data on alleged disciplinary infractions and their outcomes within the Florida Department of Corrections. The dataset includes a total of 378,632 records, detailing various types of disciplinary actions taken against incarcerated persons, as well as the types of violations that led to these actions. \n\n### Disciplinary Action Types\nThe variable `INCARCERATION_DISCIPLINARY_ACTION_TYPE_DESC` describes the type of disciplinary action taken. The following are the most common actions recorded:\n\n- **Disciplinary Confinement**: 202,840 instances\n- **Loss of Gain Time**: 77,972 instances\n- **Cashless Canteen Denial**: 34,823 instances\n- **Privilege Suspension - Other**: 14,780 instances\n- **Verbal Reprimand**: 12,873 instances\n- **Loss of Future Gain Time**: 10,365 instances\n- **Disciplinary Squad**: 8,756 instances\n- **Extra Duty**: 7,956 instances\n- **Restitution Payment**: 5,643 instances\n- **Alternative Housing**: 1,325 instances\n\nThese actions reflect the disciplinary measures taken in response to various infractions, with \"Disciplinary Confinement\" being the most frequently applied action.\n\n### Types of Violations\nThe variable `INCARCERATION_DISCIPLINARY_VIOLATION_TYPE_DESC` categorizes the types of violations leading to disciplinary actions. There are 104 unique values in this category. The most prevalent violations include:\n\n- **Noncompliance**: 63,232 instances\n- **Substance Abuse**: 50,000 instances\n- **Disorderly Behavior**: 27,513 instances\n- **Disrespect**: 26,818 instances\n- **Communication Violations**: 24,411 instances\n- **Violence**: 20,411 instances\n\nThese categories highlight the most common reasons for disciplinary actions, with \"Noncompliance\" being the leading violation.\n\n### Visualization\nThe following visualization provides a comprehensive overview of the top 50 disciplinary violations categorized by their outcomes. This visual representation allows for a clearer understanding of the relationship between types of violations and the disciplinary actions taken.\n\n<div style=\"width: 1000px; height: 1500px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"Composite_Violations_by_Outcome_Top_50_and_Categorized.html\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n### Insights and Data Quality Considerations\nThe visualization reveals patterns in disciplinary actions, indicating that certain types of violations lead to more severe consequences. For instance, \"Substance Abuse\" and \"Noncompliance\" are among the most frequently recorded violations, suggesting a need for targeted interventions in these areas.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge potential data quality concerns, such as the accuracy of the categorization process. The dataset relies on AI mapping from raw rule values into categories, which may introduce biases or inaccuracies. Researchers and policymakers should consider these limitations when interpreting the data.\n\nAdditionally, the large number of unique violation categories may complicate analysis and understanding. The AI chatbot embedded at the end of this document allows users to specify their own categories of rule infractions for review, which could enhance the accessibility and usability of the data for various stakeholders. \n\n </span>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 1.

As project manager you do not know how to code, you will only approve plans where all the data needed is present, but you will not handle anything beyond passing the coding agent a broad plan on which variables will me used and in which way. Use the exact and precise variables and variable category values from the data available to you.\n2. Use the [EXECUTE] ... [/EXECUTE] format to pass the plain language plan to the coding agent. Do not pass json data to the coding agent.\n3. Always alert users that plan execution may take a few moments after passing the plan to the coding agent.\n4. If plan execution fails, explain the issue, reassess project feasability, and try again if you can succeed with a modified plan.\n5. If unable to answer a query, throughly explain why.\n7. Explain all coding agent results in context of all available information. Present the reasoning of the coding agent in plain language before the results.\n8. Always display all Altair plots inline with your response using the format: [ALTAIR_PLOT:filename.html].\n\nDataset Information:\n- Dataset names: IncarcerationSupervision_00000, InacerationSupervisionCharge_00000, InacerationSupervisiondisciplinary_00000\n- Loaded as: df_root, df_charges, df_dis\n- Columns: df_root: {df_root.columns}, df_charges: {df_charges.columns}, df_dis{df_dis.columns}\n\nPresentation of the datasets (extended context):\n{df_root_presentation_cleaned}, {df_charges_presentation_cleaned}, {df_dis_presentation_cleaned}\n\nRemember, your role is to guide any potential analysis and explain the data, NOT to execute code directly. Always provide clear, context-rich explanations and be prepared to adjust your approach based on user feedback or failed execution attempts.\"\"\"\n        messages.insert(1, SystemMessage(content=agent_instructions))\n    \n    # Create a widget to display the streaming output\n    output_widget = widgets.Output()\n    display(output_widget)\n    \n    # Function to display Altair plots\n    def display_plot(filename):\n        iframe_html = f'''\n        <div style=\"width: 800px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\">\n        <iframe src=\"{filename}\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n        </div>\n        '''\n        display(HTML(iframe_html))\n\n    # Function to update the output widget\n    def update_output(new_text):\n        output_widget.clear_output(wait=True)\n        with output_widget:\n            # Split the text into parts\n            parts = re.split(r'(\\[ALTAIR_PLOT:[^\\]]+\\])', new_text)\n            for part in parts:\n                if part.startswith('[ALTAIR_PLOT:'):\n                    # Extract filename and display plot\n                    filename = part[13:-1]  # Remove [ALTAIR_PLOT: and ]\n                    try:\n                        display_plot(filename)\n                    except FileNotFoundError:\n                        print(f'[Error: Plot file {filename} not found]')\n                else:\n                    # Display text in red\n                    display(HTML(f'<div style=\"color: red;\">{markdown(part)}</div>'))\n    \n    # Generate a streaming response from the AI\n    full_response = \"\"\n    for chunk in llm.stream(messages):\n        if chunk.content is not None:\n            full_response += chunk.content\n            update_output(full_response)\n            time.sleep(0.05)  # Add a small delay for smoother streaming\n    \n    # Check if the AI wants to execute a plan\n    if \"[EXECUTE]\" in full_response:\n        plan_start = full_response.index(\"[EXECUTE]\") + len(\"[EXECUTE]\")\n        plan_end = full_response.index(\"[/EXECUTE]\")\n        plan = full_response[plan_start:plan_end].strip()\n        \n        try:\n            agent_result = coding_agent.process_request(user_plan=plan, context=user_input)\n            if agent_result['execution_result']['status'] == 'error':\n                error_message = f\"Error in code execution: {agent_result['execution_result']['error_message']}\"\n                if 'fixed_code' in agent_result['execution_result']:\n                    error_message += f\"\\nAttempted fix:\\n{agent_result['execution_result']['fixed_code']}\"\n                messages.append(SystemMessage(content=error_message))\n            else:\n                # Truncate the agent result for the message\n                truncated_result = {\n                    \"step_by_step_plan\": agent_result[\"step_by_step_plan\"],\n                    \"generated_code\": agent_result[\"generated_code\"],\n                    \"execution_result\": {\n                        \"status\": agent_result[\"execution_result\"][\"status\"],\n                        \"output\": coding_agent.truncate_error(agent_result[\"execution_result\"][\"output\"])\n                    }\n                }\n                messages.append(SystemMessage(content=f\"Coding Agent Result: {truncated_result}\"))\n        except Exception as e:\n            messages.append(SystemMessage(content=f\"Error in Coding Agent: {coding_agent.truncate_error(str(e))}\"))\n        \n        # Stream the new response\n        new_response = \"\"\n        for chunk in llm.stream(messages):\n            if chunk.content is not None:\n                new_response += chunk.content\n                update_output(new_response)\n                time.sleep(0.05)\n        \n        full_response = new_response\n    \n    # Add the AI's response to the memory\n    memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(full_response)\n    \n    return full_response\n\ndef run_interactive_chat_v3():\n    llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=secret_value_0, model=model, streaming=True)\n    memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=5)\n    coding_agent = CodingAgent(max_error_length=500)  # Set max error length to 500 characters\n    \n    buffer = StringIO()\n    df_root.info(buf=buffer)\n    df_root_info_str = buffer.getvalue()\n    \n    print(\"Welcome to the AI Chatbot!
